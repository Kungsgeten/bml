* BML - Bridge Bidding Markup Language
  
  The purpose of the /Bridge Bidding Markup Language/ (BML) is to
  offer an easy way of documenting contract bridge bidding
  systems. The file(s) created are supposed to be easy to read for
  both human and machines. A BML-file is created using an ordinary
  text editor (like /Notepad/).
  
  Programs have been written in order to export BML-files to the
  following formats:

  - HTML :: Outputs a .htm-file which can be used on the web. The CSS
            in bml.css must be used. Use bml2html.py

  - LaTeX :: Outputs a .tex-file which can be converted to a pdf,
             using LaTeX. The file bml.tex must be included in the
             folder where the resulting .tex-files are created. Use
             bml2latex.py

  - Full Discloure :: On the popular bridge website [[http://www.bridgebase.com][Bridge Base Online]]
                      (BBO) the players are able to submit their own
                      systems, in order to have their bids alerted
                      automatically when bidding. bml2bss.py outputs a
                      .bss-file, which can be put on BBO using the BBO
                      desktop Windows client.

  Checkout example.txt for an example of how BML looks. Also be sure
  to check out example.htm, example.tex (and example.pdf) and
  example.bss to see how BML converts to different formats.

* Using the BML converters
  
  You need Python v.3 or higher in order to use the BML
  converters. Get it from http://www.python.org.

  You can run the programs and type the name of the BML-file which
  you want to convert. Another options is to use the command line,
  for instance:

  ~python bml2bss.py mysystem.txt~

* Syntax

  The goal of BML's syntax is to be readable and easy to write. It is
  heavily inspired by [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]; a plugin included in the powerful
  text editor [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. If using org-mode in Emacs, there's some nifty
  features which might make it easier to work with BML.

  Perhaps the best way to get an introduction to BML is to read
  example.txt, as it show of a lot of the features of BML.

  A BML file can contain a number of elements: bidding tables, text
  paragraphs, section names, lists and metadata. All elements must be
  separated by a blank line.

** Bidding tables

   The most powerful part of BML is the ability to write bidding
   tables easily. Let's take a look at this basic precision structure:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   1C  Any hand with 16+ hcp
     1D  Artificial. 0--7 hcp
       1H  Any hand with 20+ hcp
     1HS 5+ suit, forcing to game (8+ hcp)
     1N  Natural game force, 8+ hcp
     2m  5+ suit, forcing to game (8+ hcp)
     2M  6+ suit, 5--7 hcp
   1D  Nebulous with 2+!d, 11--15 hcp
   1HS 5+ suit, 11--15 hcp
   1N  14--16 hcp
   2C  6+!c or 5!c and 4!h/!s, 11--15 hcp
   2D  4414. 4405, 4305 or 3405, 11--15 hcp
   2HS Weak
   2N  Weak with 5-5 minors
   #+END_SRC

   Pretty simple, right? A row is written according to the format
   <bid> <description>. Each bid may have sub-bids, by increasing the
   indentation (number of spaces). The text !c, !d, !h and !s will be
   converted to suit symbols when exported (and so will the bid names
   in the bid table).

   When writing bidding tables you may sometimes want to have a
   description with linebreaks. This can be done in BML by indenting
   the description lines at the same level. Here's an example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   1C  Polish club, one of three:
       a) 12--14 NT
       b) 15+ hcp and 5+!c
       c) 18+ hcp any distribution
   #+END_SRC

   Because of the description linebreak feature it isn't possible to
   start a sub-bid at the same indentation level as the previous
   bid's description.

   You may add equal signs when separating bids and descriptions,
   instead of only whitespaces, if you prefer that notation. This can
   make the bidtable easier to read:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   1m = 3+ minor
   1M = 5+ major
   1N = 15--17
        May have 5M, 6m or 5-4 minors
   2C = Strong and forcing
   2X = Weak
   2N = 20--21
   #+END_SRC

   As bids you could type for instance 1C, to show the bid of 1
   club. D(iamond), H(eart), S(spade) and N(o trump) work
   too. You could also use to suits, like 3CD to define both 3C and
   3D at the same time. There's also some other special cases:

   - <digit>m :: Defines both <digit>C and <digit>D
   - <digit>M :: Defines both <digit>H and <digit>S
   - <digit>X :: Defines <digit>C, <digit>D, <digit>H and <digit>S
   - <digit>red :: Defines <digit>D and <digit>H
   - <digit>step[s] :: Defines the bid <digit> steps above the parent
                    bid (the previous bid made). In response to 1C,
                    1step would be 1D, 2steps would be 1H etc.

   It is worth noticing that whitespaces before the *first bid* in the
   bidding table is ignored. Other indentation whitespaces are part
   of the syntax.

   You probably won't want to add your entire system to a single
   bidding table. The first bid in a bidding table is the start of a
   sequence, if the characters - and/or ; are included in the
   bid. Here's an example of adding the answers to Stayman to an
   already exisiting sequence.

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   1N-2C;
   2D No 4 card major
     2H 5+!h, 4!s, invitational
     2S 5+!s, invitational
     3HS Smolen (5+ cards in other major)
   2HS 4+ suit
   2N  4-4 majors, minimum
   3C  4-4 majors, maximum
   #+END_SRC

   If a bid has already been defined, it will not be overwritten; the
   first definition stands. Normal bids (like 2C) are evaluated before
   special bids (like 2X), hence this would work:

    #+BEGIN_SRC
    2C Strong, forcing
      2D Waiting
    2X Weak
      2N Ogust
    #+END_SRC

*** Competetive auctions

    In order to describe competetive auctions, use parantheses around
    the opponents' bids. All bids, even passes, needs to be described
    in an competetive auction. P stands for Pass, D is for Double and
    R is for Redouble. Here's an example of a defense to 1NT:

    #+BEGIN_SRC
    (1NT)---
    D   Strength, ca 15+
    2C  At least 5-4 majors
      (D)
        P  5+!c, suggestion to play
        R  Asking for better/longer major
        2D 5+!d, suggestion to play
      (P)
        2D Asking for better/longer major
    2D  A weak major or a strong minor
    2HS Constructive
    2N  5-5 minors
    3X  Preemptive
    #+END_SRC

    Note that the above only defines competing directly over 1NT,
    balancing over 1NT would be written as ~(1NT)-P-(P)---~ instead
    of ~(1NT)---~.


*** Hiding from export

    If you add #HIDE at the beginning of a row somewhere in the
    bidding table, the bidding table will only be exported to Full
    Disclosure; not HTML nor LaTeX.

*** Copy/Cut/Paste
    
    You could copy/cut sections of bidding tables. This is done by
    writing #COPY <name> or #CUT <name>. The <name> is later used
    when pasting the copy. The difference between #COPY and #CUT is
    that #COPY will preserve the copied rows, while #CUT will remove
    them (and hence they will not be parsed until
    pasted). Use #ENDCOPY or #ENDCUT to specify where the
    copying/cutting ends.

    To paste a copied/cut section, use #PASTE <name>. #PASTE takes
    indentation into consideration, so for instance a #CUT may be
    done at the top level of the document and later pasted deep into
    a bidding table. You can also replace text in the copy when
    pasting, a somewhat complex but powerful tool. This is done by
    typing #PASTE <name> <target>=<replacement>. A paste may have
    several targets and replacements. Let's look at an example:

    #+BEGIN_SRC
    #CUT transfer
    2\R Transfer
      2\M Transfer accept
      3\M Super accept
    #ENDCUT

    1N---
    2C Stayman
    #PASTE transfer \R=D \M=H
    #PASTE transfer \R=H \M=S
    #+END_SRC

*** Seat and vulnerability dependency

    By default it doesn't matter which seat you're in, or which
    vulnerability it is, when you bid. Full Disclosure, however,
    allows for different meanings of sequences depending on these
    factors.

    To change the vulnerability (for the forthcoming bidding tables)
    type #VUL <we><them>. Both <we> and <them> can be Y, N or 0: Yes,
    No or Doesn't matter. #VUL Y0 would mean that where vulnerable,
    but it doesn't matter if the opponents are.

    Seat is changed in a similar way: #SEAT <seat>, where <seat> can
    be 0 (doesn't matter), 1, 2, 3, 4, 12 (first or second) or 34
    (third or fourth).

** Headers and paragraphs

   In order to write text, just write normal text and separate the
   paragraphs by blank lines. Any whitespace in the beginning of a
   row will be ignored.

   In order to separate the document into sections, asterisks are
   used. One for the first level, two for the second level etc.

   The character combinations !c, !d, !h and !s will be converted into
   suit symbols when exported, just as in the case of bidding tables.

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   * The 1!c opening

     Opening 1!c shows at least 16+ hcp, and is forcing. The
     continuation is fairly natural.

     Some hands might be upgraded to 1!c due to distribution, but
     wildly distributional hands might also be downgraded to avoid
     problems if the opponents preempt.

   ** The 1!d negative

      Responding 1!d shows a hand which doesn't have enough values to
      establish a game force.
   #+END_SRC

   In the examples above whitespace are used in the beginning of the
   paragraph lines, in order to make the text easier to read, but
   doing this is optional.

** Metadata
   Metadata are written like ~#+METADATA:data~, where ~METADATA~ is the
   type of the data and ~data~ is the actual content. The available
   type of metadata is:

   - TITLE :: The system's title, and also the title of the document
   - DESCRIPTION :: A short description of the system
   - AUTHOR :: The author of the document

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   #+TITLE: Precision club
   #+AUTHOR: John Smith
   #+DESCRIPTION: Strong club system. Nebulous diamond and 5 card majors
   #+END_SRC

   The metadata can be set anywhere in the BML file. If the metadata
   has already been set, it will not be overwritten.

** Deal diagrams
   It is possible to create deal diagrams with BML. *Right now these
   can only be exported to LaTeX.* Here's an example of a deal diagram:

   #+begin_src
   N None 35 4SXS hK
   N Kxx T9 xxx Q987x
   E Jx AJxxx AJx KTx
   S A987xx - Q9xx Axx
   W QT KQxxxx KTx Jx
   #+end_src
   
   The first row is the header row. The header row adds additional
   information about the deal, and may be excluded if you only want to
   show the cards. The header row can include the following
   information:

   - Dealer :: The dealer of this deal. You simply write the first
               letter of the player: ~N E S W~
   - Vulnerability :: Who is vulnerable on this deal? You write ~NS~
                      (north/south), ~EW~ (east/west), ~None~ or ~All~
   - Board number :: If you write a digit, this will be interpreted as
                     the board number. 35 in the example above.
   - Final contract :: To specify the final contract of the deal, you
                       simply write the contract (capital letters) and
                       the player which played the contract. In the
                       example above this is ~4SXS~ (four spades
                       doubled, played by south). If the board is
                       passed out, write ~P~.
   - Lead :: The deal is written with a lower-case suit (~s h d c~), followed by
             the card (a number or ~A K Q J T~).

   Any of the above parameters may be excluded from the header row if
   you do not want to include all the info. They may also be entered
   in any order. They may be followed by a comma, to make it more
   readable. The board number may have a # in front of it. You may
   have any other words in the header row as well, to increase
   readability.
   
   After the (optional) header row, the hands are specified. Each hand
   is written on its own row, starting with the player holding the
   hand (~N E S W~), optionally followed by a colon. Any hand may be
   excluded if you'd like a diagram not showing all hands. A hand may
   have any number of cards but all four suits must be specified,
   separated by space, in the order spades, hearts, diamonds clubs. A
   dash ~-~ is used to notate a void. A card is notated by a number,
   ~A K Q J T~ or ~x~.
   
   Here's an example of how the above example diagram may be more
   readable:

   #+begin_src
   #35, Dealer N, None vul, played 4SXS with hK lead
   N: Kxx    T9     xxx  Q987x
   E: Jx     AJxxx  AJx  KTx
   S: A987xx -      Q9xx Axx
   W: QT     KQxxxx KTx  Jx
   #+end_src

** Lists

   There are two types of lists available in BML; ordered lists and
   unordered lists. The syntax is easy:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   - The first item in an unordered list
   - The second item
   - Etc..

   1. The first item in an ordered list
   2. The second item
   3. Etc..
   #+END_SRC

   At the moment it is not possible to have different levels in a BML
   list.

** Comments

   If you want to write text which shouldn't be shown in the export,
   use ~//comment here~.
   
** Including other files

   It is possible to split your system notes into different files. To
   include another file in a document, use #INCLUDE <filename>. The
   filename may be a relative path. Let's say you have made a BML file
   for a multi opening, and placed it into a subfolder called
   "modules". You could now write #INCLUDE modules/multi.txt where
   you want the file to be inserted.
** Font styles
   By surrounding words/sentences with / * or = you can make them
   italic, bold or monospace.

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   /Here's/ *an* =example= (italic, bold, monospace)
   #+END_SRC

#+DESCRIPTION: Short club with transfer responses.

* Introduction

  Welcome to BML! This is a normal paragraph, and above we can see
  the TITLE, the AUTHOR and the DESCRIPTION of the file. TITLE is
  the name of the system and DESCRIPTION is a short summary of how
  the system works. AUTHOR is self explanatory. Introduction above,
  headed by an asterisk, sets a section at the first level (the second
  level would have two asterisks etc).

  The system presented in this example file is meant to showcase many
  of the current features in BML. Let's start with the basic opening
  structure of the system:
  
  1C  2+!c. Natural / 11--13 bal / 17--19 bal
  1D  4+ suit, unbalanced
  1M  5+ suit
  1N  14--16
  2C  20--21 bal / Any game force
  2D  6+!h or 6+!s, 5--9 hcp
  2HS 6+ suit, 10--13 hcp
  2N  22--24
  3X  Preemptive
  3N  Gambling
  
  The above is an example of a bidding table; the reason why BML is
  more suited for bridge system notes than other markup languages. You
  start by writing the bid, then a number of whitespaces, and then the
  description of the bid. Simple! C is for clubs, D for diamonds, H
  for hearts, S for spades and N for no trump. There's also some
  special cases which you could use, above we use 1M (1H and 1S), 2HS
  (2H and 2S) and 3X (3C, 3D, 3H and 3S). We'll see more of these
  later.

* The 1!c opening

  You might have noticed the !c in the title of this section? This
  will be replaced by a club suit symbol when exported. The same is
  true for !d, !h and !s (but these will be converted to diamonds,
  hearts and spades, ofcourse).

  In this example we use transfer responses to the 1!c opening:

  1C---
  1red Transfer. 4+ major, 0+ hcp
  1S   INV+ with 5+!d / Negative NT
  1N   Game forcing, 5+!c or balanced
  2C   5+!c, 5--9 hcp
  2X   6+ suit, 4--8 hcp
  2N   Invitational

  By writing 1C--- we define that the following bids should be
  continuations to the sequence 1C. We could write 1C- or 1C-- too,
  the number of dashes only matters to the way the output looks. Also
  note the 1red response, this defines both 1D and 1H.

** After a transfer

   This section has two asterisks, meaning it will be at level two
   (so its a subsection). You might also have noticed that the
   paragraphs, the sections and the bidtables are separated by a
   blank line? This is important in BML, as the blankline are used to
   separate elements.

   1C-1D;
   1H Minimum with 2--3!h
     1S 4+!h, 4!s, at most invitational
     1N Sign off
     2C Puppet to 2!d
       2D Forced
         2H Mildly invitational with 5!h
         2S Invitational, 5+!h and 4!s
         2N Strongly invitational with 5!h
         3m Invitational with 4!h and 5+ minor
         3H 6!h, about 11--12 hcp
     2D Artificial game force
     2H 6+!h, about 9--10 hcp
   1S 5+!c, 4+!s, unlimited
   1N 17--19 bal, 2--3!h
   2C 5+!c, unbal, 0--2!h, 0--3!s
   2D Reverse
   2H Minimum, 4!h
   2S 16+ hcp, 5+!c and 4+!h
     3D Retransfer
       3H
         3S Cue bid, slam interest
         4CD Cue bid, slam interest
         4H To play
     3H Invitational
     3S Splinter
     4CD Splinter
     4H To play
   2N 16+ hcp, 6+!c. 18+ if 3!h
     3C Suggestion to play
     3D Relay
       3H 3!h, 18+ hcp
     3H Game forcing with 6+!h
   3C 15--17 hcp, 6+!c and 3!h
     3D Retransfer
     3H Invitational
   3D 17--19 bal, 4!h
     3H To play
   3H 13--15 hcp, good hand, 5+!c and 4!h
     3N Asking for singleton

   This bidding table shows a couple of new features. The most
   prominent is the ability to add continuations directly in the
   table, by using whitespaces. We also see another example of
   appending bids to an existing sequence, by using 1C-1D; in the
   beginning. There's also the use of 3m, meaning both 3C and 3D.

* Defense to 1NT

  Defining bidding when both sides bid is a little bit more tricky,
  since you have to write all the bids (even passes). The opponents'
  bid are indicated by encapsulating them in parantheses:

  (1N)---
  D   Strength, ca 15+
  2C  At least 5-4 majors
    (D)
      P  5+!c, suggestion to play
      R  Asking for better/longer major
      2D 5+!d, suggestion to play
    (P)
      2D Asking for better/longer major
  2D  A weak major or a strong minor
    (P)
      2H Pass/correct
      2S Pass/correct
      2N Asking
  2HS Constructive
  2N  5-5 minors
  3X  Preemptive

  P is used for Pass, D for Double and R for Redouble. Note that the
  above is only for a direct overcall over 1NT. To define the above
  also when balancing, you would have to write:

  (1N)-P-(P)---
  D   Strength, ca 15+
  2C  At least 5-4 majors
    (D)
      P  5+!c, suggestion to play
      R  Asking for better/longer major
      2D 5+!d, suggestion to play
    (P)
      2D Asking for better/longer major
  2D  A weak major or a strong minor
    (P)
      2H Pass/correct
      2S Pass/correct
      2N Asking
  2HS Constructive
  2N  5-5 minors
  3X  Preemptive

  You might also do this when the opponents interfere:

  1C-(1D)---
  D  4+!h
  1H 4+!s
  1S INV+ with 5+!d / Negative NT
  1N Game forcing, 5+!c or balanced
  2C 5+!c, 5--9 hcp
  2X 6+ suit, 4--8 hcp
  2N Invitational

* Lists

  At last I'd like to show you how to make lists in BML. It is pretty
  simple:

  - Here's a list!
  - With a couple of
  - Items in it

You could also make ordered lists:

  1. This is ordered
  2. Just add numbers
  3. To each item
